The Sentiment Analyzer Function takes in a string of text or a URl and scans it for terms that indicate a certain sentiment. It returns the cumulative sentiment of the text(positive or negative), the subjectivity (subjective or objective) and the polarity confidence, a decimal number between 0 and 1 that represents the certainty of the sentiment. Here's how to use it in a Flo: 

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Sentiment Analyzer Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from another cards and drop it into the Input field. Remember, Sentiment Analyzer takes in both text and URls. 
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the results from the Sentiment Analyzer card to empty fields in other cards. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
