###How do I use the Search Function?
<!---Search function has changed since I saw it last, what does it do now?--->

The Search Function takes in  and returns . For example, Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the XX Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from the other cards and drop it into the Input field
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the Result to the field where you want it to go. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
