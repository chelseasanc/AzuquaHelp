        <p>The Search Function takes in <code>string</code> (a string of text), <code>start</code> (an integer that determines the index where your search starts), and <code>end</code> (an integer that determines the index where your search ends). Search returns the text between those two indices. Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
        <li>Find the Search Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
        <li>Drag data from the other cards and drop it into the Input field. You can also type into any field.</li>
        <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
        <li>Drag the Result from the Search card an empty field on another card.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card. </p>
