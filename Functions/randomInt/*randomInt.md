###How do I use the RandomInt Function?
The RandomInt Function takes in two numbers and returns a random integer between those bounds. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the RandomInt Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from other cards and drop it into the Input fields.
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the result from the RandomInt card to an empty field in another card. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
