###How do I use the XX Function?
The Tweet Parser Function takes in a tweet as a string of text and returns the different parts of the tweet: tags, users, retweets, and the text. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Tweet Parser Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from another card (like the Twitter Channel) and drop it into the Input field. 
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the results you want to use to empty fields on different cards. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
