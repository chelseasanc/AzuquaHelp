The Concept Function takes in a string of text or an article  URl and returns the major concepts, with words separated by hyphens. For example, putting in the URl of an article about Azuqua might return "Azuqua" and "Cloud_Integration." Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Concept Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from the other cards and drop it into the Input field. You can put in text or a URl.
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the list of concepts to the field where you want it to go. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
