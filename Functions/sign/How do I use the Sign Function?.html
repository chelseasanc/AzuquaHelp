        <p>The Sign Function takes in a number and returns its sign (1 if it&#39;s positive, -1 if it&#39;s negative, 0 if it&#39;s 0 or not a number). Here&#39;s how to use it in a Flo&otilde;:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
        <li>Find the Sign Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
        <li>Drag data from another card and drop it into the Input field. You can also type into any input field. </li>
        <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
        <li>Drag the Result from the Sign card to an empty field on another card.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card. </p>
