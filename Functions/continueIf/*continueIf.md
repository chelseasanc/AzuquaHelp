###How do I use the Continue If Function?
The Continue If Function will only continue a Flõ if certain conditions are met, letting you control how your Flõs move forward. It takes in four pieces of data: variable A, variable B, and two optional fields that will return an error code and a message if your Flõ is stopped. Here's how to use it in a Flõ:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Continue If Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from the other cards and drop it into the Input field
4. Add more cards to your Flõ: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. Remember, if the Continue If Function is false, these actions won't be taken. If you want them to happen even if the Continue If Function returns 
5. Drag the Result to the field where you want it to go. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
