The Smaller Function takes in two numbers and returns true if the first number is smaller than the second, or false if the first number is bigger. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Smaller Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from other cards and drop it into the Input fields, or type the numbers in. 
4. Add more cards to your Flõ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the result from the Smaller card to an empty field on another card. Combine smaller with the Continue If function to only continue the Flõ if Smaller returns true. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
