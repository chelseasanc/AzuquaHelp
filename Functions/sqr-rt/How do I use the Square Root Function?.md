The Square Root Function takes in a number and returns its square root. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Square Root Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from other cards and drop it into the Input field. You can also type into any field. 
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the result from the Square Root card to the an empty field in another card. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
