The Divide Function takes in two numbers (a dividend and divisor) and returns the quotient. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Divide Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from other cards and drop it into the input fields. Order is important&mdash;put the number you want to divide in the first field, and the number you want to divide it by in the second.
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the Result to the field where you want it to go. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
