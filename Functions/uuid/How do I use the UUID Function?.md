The UUID Function generates a universally unique udentifier; a string of 32 characters separated by hyphens that is practically unique. It's useful for generating unique links and labels for data without any central coordination. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the UUID Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the result from the UUID card to an empty field on another card.

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
