###How do I use the Entities Function?
The Entities Function takes in a string of text or an article URl, then extracts the names of people, organizations, products, and locations, as well as email addresses and phone numbers.  Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Entities Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from other cards and drop it into the Input field. Remember, Entities takes in both URls and raw text. 
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the Results from the Entities card to empty fields on other cards. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
