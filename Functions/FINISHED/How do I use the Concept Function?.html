        <p>The Concept Function takes in a string of text or an article URL and returns the major concepts, with words separated by hyphens. For example, putting in the URL of an article about Azuqua might return &quot;Azuqua&quot; and &quot;Cloud_Integration.&quot; Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
        <li>Find the Concept Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
        <li>Drag data from the other cards and drop it into the Input field. You can put in text or a URL.</li>
        <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
        <li>Drag the concept list from the Concept card to an empty field on another card.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card. </p>
