        <p>The Match Function takes in a string of text and an expression to search for within the larger string. If it finds the expression, Match returns the index where it is located. If not, it returns -1. Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;:</p>
     

        <ol>
        <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
        <li>Find the Match Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
        <li>Drag data from other cards and drop it into the input fields, or type in the text you would like compared.</li>
        <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
        <li>Drag the result from the Match card to an empty field on another card. Combine Match with Continue If to only execute the rest of a Fl&otilde; if the text you&#39;re looking at contains a certain term. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card. </p>
