        <p>The Character At Function takes in a string of text and a numeric index, then returns the character that is at that index in the string. If you put in &quot;What is the meaning of life and everything?&quot; and 42, Character At will return &quot;?&quot; because if you start at 0, &quot;?&quot; is the 42nd character in that string. Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
        <li>Find the Character At Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
        <li>Drag data from the other cards and drop it into the Input fields. Be sure that you&#39;re putting text into the <code>string</code> field and a number into the <code>index</code> field. You can type an input into either field. </li>
        <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
        <li>Drag the Result to the field where you want it to go. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card. </p>
