        <p>The Concatenate Function takes in two strings of text and combines them into one string. Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
        <li>Find the Concatenate Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
        <li>Drag data from the other cards and drop it into the Input fields. You can drop in two pieces of text, or combine text, URLs, and numbers. Remember, you can also type data into any field. </li>
        <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
        <li>Drag the result from the Concatenate card to an empty field on another card.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card. </p>
