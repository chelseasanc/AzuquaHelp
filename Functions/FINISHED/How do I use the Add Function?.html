      <p>The Add Function takes in two numbers and returns their sum. Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;: </p>

      <ol>
      <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
      <li>Find the Add Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
      <li>Drag data from other cards and drop it into the two Input fields (order is not important). If you want to, you can also type a number in to either field to use the same value every time this &otilde; runs. </li>
      <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
      <li>Drag the Result to the field where you want it to go. </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can plug into a card. </p>
