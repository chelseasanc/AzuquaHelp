        <p>The Random String Function takes in <code>length</code> (an integer) and returns a string of random characters of that length. It&#39;s useful for generating individualized sign-up links. Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
        <li>Find the Random String Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
        <li>Type an integer into the Input field, or drag data from other cards and drop it in. You can also type into any field.</li>
        <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
        <li>Drag the Result from the Random String card to an empty field in another card.<br></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card. </p>
