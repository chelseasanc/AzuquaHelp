        <p>The Tweet Parser Function takes in a tweet as a string of text and returns the different parts of the tweet: tags, users, retweets, and the text. Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
        <li>Find the Tweet Parser Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
        <li>Drag data from another card (like the Twitter Channel) and drop it into the Input field. You can also type into any field.</li>
        <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
        <li>Drag the results you want to use from the Tweet Parser card to empty fields on other cards. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card. </p>
