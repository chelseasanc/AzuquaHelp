        <p>The Article Summary Function takes in the URL of an article and returns a string of text  summarizing of the most important points. Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;: </p>

        <ol>
        <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
        <li>Find the Article Summary Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
        <li>Drag a piece of data from another card into the Input field. Remember, this Function only takes in a URL. Other cards, like the Tweet Parser Function or the Google Alerts Channel, will put out URLs that can be dragged to the Article Summary card. </li>
        <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
        <li>Drag the Result to the field where you want it to go. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can plug into a card. </p>
