        <p>The Replace Function takes in three pieces of text: a target string, a substring of text that you want replace, and the string that you want to replace it with. It returns the modified target string, and can be useful for generating personalized emails from templates. Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
        <li>Find the Replace Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
        <li>Drag data from the other cards and drop it into the Input fields, or type in the text. </li>
        <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
        <li>Drag the result from the Replace card into an empty field on another card.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card. </p>
