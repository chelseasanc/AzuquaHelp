        <p>The Sentiment Analyzer Function takes in a string of text or a URl and scans it for terms that indicate a certain sentiment. It returns the cumulative sentiment of the text (positive or negative), the subjectivity (subjective or objective) and the polarity confidence, a decimal number between 0 and 1 that represents the certainty of the sentiment. Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
        <li>Find the Sentiment Analyzer Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
        <li>Drag data from another card and drop it into the Input field. Remember, Sentiment Analyzer takes in both text and URLs. </li>
        <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
        <li>Drag the results from the Sentiment Analyzer card to empty fields in other cards. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card. </p>
