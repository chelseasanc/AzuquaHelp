Hashtag Suggestion analyzes a string of text or a URl and returns relevant hashtags for use in tweets or Facebook posts. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Hashtag Suggestion Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from another card and drop it into the input field. Remember, Hashtag Suggestion will accept both URl and text inputs.
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the result from the Hashtag Suggestion card to an empty field on another card. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
