The Lookup Function takes in a list of key/value pairs and a key, and returns the value associated with that key. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Lookup Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it over.
4. Type in or copy/paste the list of key value pairs that you want to check against into the `List of values` field. The format of the list is key=value, seperated by commas (e.g. captain=Picard, first-officer=Riker, chief-medical-officer=Crusher). There should be no brackets around the list. Click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it back over. 
4. Drag data from other cards and drop it into the Input field. You can also type data into any field.
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the result from the Lookup card to the an empty field on another card. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
