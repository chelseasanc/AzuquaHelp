        <p>The Lookup Function takes in a list of key/value pairs and a key, and returns the value associated with that key. Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
        <li>Find the Lookup Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
        <li>Click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it over.</li>
        <li>Type in or copy/paste the list of key/value pairs that you want to check into the <code>List of values</code> field. The format of the list is key=value, seperated by commas (e.g. captain=Picard, first-officer=Riker, chief-medical-officer=Crusher). There should be no brackets around the list. Click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it back over. </li>
        <li>Drag data from other cards and drop it into the Input field. You can also type data into any field.</li>
        <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
        <li>Drag the result from the Lookup card to the an empty field on another card. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.</p>
