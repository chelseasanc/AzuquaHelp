###How do I use the Exponent Function?
The Exponent Function takes in two numbers and returns the first number raised to the power of the second. For example, if you put in 3 and 2, the Exponent Function will return 9. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Exp Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from the other cards and drop it into the Input fields. 
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the result from the Exponent card to an empty field on another card. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
