###How do I use the Lowercase Function?
The Lowercase Function takes in a string of text and returns that same text, but all lower case. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Lowercase Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from another card and drop it into the input field.
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the result from the Lowercase card to an empty field in another card.  

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
