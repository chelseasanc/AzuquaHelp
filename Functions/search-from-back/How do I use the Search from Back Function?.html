        <p>The Search from Back Function takes in <code>string</code> (a string of text), <code>searchValue</code> (the term you want to search for), and <code>fromIndex</code> (an ending index in your text). If the <code>searchValue</code> term appears in the <code>string</code> before the <code>fromIndex</code> value, Search from Back returns the index where <code>searchValue</code> starts. If <code>searchValue</code> is not in <code>string</code>, it returns -1. Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
        <li>Find the Search from Back Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
        <li>Drag data from the other cards and drop it into the Input fields. You can also type data into any field. Keep in mind that <code>string</code> and <code>searchValue</code> take in text inputs, while <code>fromIndex</code> is a number.</li>
        <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
        <li>Drag the result from this card to an empty field on another card. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card. </p>
