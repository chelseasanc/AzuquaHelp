The Mod Function takes in two numbers and returns the remainder when the first number is divided by the second. For example, if you put in 7 and 3, the Mod function will return 4. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Mod Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from other cards and drop it into the Input fields.
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the result from the Mod card to an empty field in another card. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
