The Date and Time Function will tell you when your Flõ runs. It's useful for keeping track of when your Flo is triggered. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Date and Time Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Click the gear symbol in the corner of the card to flip it over.
4. Configure the time zone and date format you would like the Function to return, then click the gear again to return to the other side. 
4. Add more cards to your Flõ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the Results to the fields where you want them to go. You can use the full date and time, or just pieces (like the day and month).

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
