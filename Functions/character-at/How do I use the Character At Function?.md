The XX Function takes in a string of text and a numeric index, then returns the character that is at that index in the string. If you put in "What is the meaning of life and everything?" and 42, Character At will return "?" because if you start at 0, "?" is the 42nd character in that string. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Character At Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from the other cards and drop it into the Input fields. Be sure that you're putting text into the `string` field and a number into the `index` field. You can type an input into either field. 
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the Result to the field where you want it to go. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
