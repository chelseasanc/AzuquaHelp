###How do I use the Upper case Function?
The Upper Case Function takes in a string of text and returns the same string, but ALL IN UPPER CASE. It's useful for imitating teenagers on social media. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Upper Case Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from other cards and drop it into the Input field.
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the result from the Upper Case card to an empty field on another card. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
