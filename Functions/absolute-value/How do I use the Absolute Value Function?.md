The Absolute Value Function takes the absolute value of a number. If it’s been a while since high school math, that’s the value of a number regardless of sign. If you put in 42, it will return 42. If you put in -42, it will still return 42. Here's how to use it in a Flõ: 

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Absolute Value Function and click it to add a card to the designer.
2. Drag a piece of data from another card and drop it into the Input field. 
3. Add more cards to your Flõ: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
4. Drag the Result to the field where you want it to go. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can plug into a card.
