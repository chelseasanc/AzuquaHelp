      <p>The Absolute Value Function takes the absolute value of a number. If it&#39;s been a while since high school math, that&#39;s the value of a number regardless of sign. If you put in 42, it will return 42. If you put in -42, it will still return 42. Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;: </p>

      <ol>
      <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
      <li>Find the Absolute Value Function and click it to add a card to the designer.</li>
      <li>Drag a piece of data from another card and drop it into the Input field. </li>
      <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
      <li>Drag the Result to the field where you want it to go. </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can plug into a card. </p>
