	<p>The Continue If Function will only continue a Fl&otilde; if certain conditions are met, letting you control how your Fl&otilde;s move forward. It takes in four pieces of data: variable A, variable B, and two optional fields that will return an error code and a message if your Fl&otilde; is stopped. Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
	<li>Find the Continue If Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
	<li>Drag the data you want to compare from other cards and drop it into the Input fields. You can also type into either field. </li>
	<li><p>Select the kind of comparison you want to make.
	<table>
	<tr>
	    <th>Operator</th>
	    <th>Meaning</th>
	    <th>Use Case</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>=</td>
	    <td>Equals</td> 
	    <td>Compare two strings of text or two numbers and only continue when they are the same.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>!=</td>
	    <td>Does not equal</td>
	    <td>Compare two strings of text or two numbers and only continue when they are not equal</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>&gt;</td>
	    <td>Greater than</td>
	    <td>Compare two numbers and only continue when the first one is larger than the second.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>&gt;=</td>
	    <td>Greater than or equal to</td>
	    <td>Compare two numbers and only continue when the first one is larger than or equal to the second.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>&lt;</td>
	    <td>Lesser than</td>
	    <td>Compare two numbers and only continue when the first one is smaller than the second.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>&lt;=</td>
	    <td>Lesser than or equal to</td>
	    <td>Compare two numbers and only continue when the first one is smaller than or equal to the second.</td>
	</tr>
	</table></p></li>
	<li><p>If you would like to return an error message when Continue If stops a Fl&otilde; from running, type in the <code>statuscode</code> and <code>message</code> into the input fields.</p></li>
	<li><p>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. Remember, if the Continue If Function returns false, any following Actions won&#39;t be taken. </p></li>
	</ol>

	<p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card. </p>
