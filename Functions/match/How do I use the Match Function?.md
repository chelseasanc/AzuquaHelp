The Match Function takes in a string of text and an expression to search for within the larger string. If it finds the expression, Match returns the index where it is located. If not, it returns -1. If your input is an array instead of a string, you should [use the Lookup Function](). Here's how to use Match in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Match Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from other cards and drop it into the input fields, or type in the text you would like compared.
4. Add more cards to your Flõ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the result from the Match card to an empty field on another card. Combine Match with Continue If to only execute the rest of a Flõ if the text you're looking at contains a certain term. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
