        <p>The Classification Function takes in the text or URL of an article and returns <code>label</code>, (the classification of this article based on the IPTC International Subject News Codes), <code>code</code> (the numeric ID assigned to that classification) and <code>confidence</code> (a decimal number between 0 and 1 that indicates the certainty of this classification). Here&#39;s how to use it in a Fl&otilde;:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.</li>
        <li>Find the Classification Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. </li>
        <li>Drag data from the other cards and drop it into the Input fields. </li>
        <li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. </li>
        <li>Drag the Result to the field where you want it to go. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won&#39;t help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card. </p>
