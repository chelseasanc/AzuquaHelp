The Classification Function takes in the text or URl of an article and returns `label`, (the classification of this article based on the IPTC International Subject News Codes), `code` (the numeric ID assigned to that classification) and `confidence` (a decimal number between 0 and 1 that indicates the certainty of this classification). Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Classification Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from the other cards and drop it into the Input fields. 
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the Result to the field where you want it to go. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
