###How do I use the Round Function?
The Round Function takes in two numbers: the number you want to round, and the number of decimal places you want to round it to. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Round Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from other cards and drop it into the Input fields, or type in the numbers. 
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the result from the Round card to an empty field in another card. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
