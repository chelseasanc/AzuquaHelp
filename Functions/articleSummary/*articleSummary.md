####How do I use the Article Sunmary Function?

The Article Simmary Function takes in the URl of an article and returns a string of text  summarizing of the most important points. Here's how to use it in a Flõ: 

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Article Summary Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag a piece of data from another card into the Input field. Remember, this Function only takes in a URl. Other cards, like the Tweet Parser Function or the Google Alerts Channel, will put out URls that can be dragged to the Article Summary card. 
4. Add more cards to your Flõ: Channels, other Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the Result to the field where you want it to go. 

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can plug into a card.
