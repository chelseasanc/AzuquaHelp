###How do I use the Floor Function?
The Floor Function takes in a number and returns that number rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if you put 42.35 into the Floor Function, it will return 42. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the Floor Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Drag data from another card and drop it into the Input field.
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the result from the Floor card to an empty field in another card.

Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
