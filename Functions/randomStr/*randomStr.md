###How do I use the RandomStr Function?
The RandomStr Function takes in an integer and returns a string of random characters of that length. It's useful for generating individualized sign-up links. Here's how to use it in a Flo:

1. From the menu in the right-hand side of the designer, select the Functions tab.
2. Find the RandomStr Function in the list and click it to add the card to the designer. 
3. Type an integer into the Input field, or drag data from other cards and drop it in. 
4. Add more cards to your Fl√µ: Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag the Result from the RandomStr card to an empty field in another card.  
 
Keep in mind the kind of data that each field accepts (putting a number into the Tweet Parser Function won't help you too much). Usually, there will be labels to help you understand the sort of data you can drop into a card.
