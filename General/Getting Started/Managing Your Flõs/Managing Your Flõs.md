To manage your Flõs, click the "My Flõs" link in the nav bar. If you've already [built some Fl&otilde;s]() or [added Fl&otilde;s from the Gallery](), you should see them displayed here. 

####Sorting 

You can sort your Fl&otilde;s using the options in the upper right corner of the My Fl&otilde;s view. You can look at your most recent Fl&otilde;s, sort by name, or sort by creator. You can also choose if you want to see All Fl&otilde;s in your organization, just Fl&otilde;s that you created, only active Fl&otilde;s or only inactive Fl&otilde;s.

You can quickly rename your Fl&otilde; from within the designer. You can also publish to Fl&otilde; to the Gallery to share it with other organizations.
