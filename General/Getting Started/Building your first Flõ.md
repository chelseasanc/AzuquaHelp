Fl&otilde;s allow you to connect as many apps as you want into one automated process. They are so easy to build that anyone (even someone without a technical background) can create them, and in minutes you can put together a custom integration that would normally take months to implement. Check out the demo below, or keep reading to learn more about building Flõs.

1. **Open a new Fl&otilde;**
<p>To get started with your first Fl&otilde;, log in to Azuqua then click the green "New Fl&otilde;" button in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Give your Fl&otilde; a name, and you're ready to get started.</p>

1. **Choose a Channel**
<p>Azuqua connects over 40 cloud applications, or Channels. To start your Flõ, choose the Channel you want to monitor from the menu on the right-hand side of the designer.</p>[<p>Read more about channels.</p>]()

2. **Choose an Event**
<p>From the list on the left, select the Event you want to watch for on this channel. Every time this Event occurs, we’ll automatically start your Flõ.</p>

3. **Configure the Card**
<p>Every card you add to the designer needs to be configured with your account data, but only once. After you’ve authorized Azuqua to access this app, you don’t need to do it again.</p>

4. **Transform Data with Functions**
<p>If you want to, you can add business, math, and logic Functions to your Fl&otilde;. That way, you can add value to your data as it travels through the cloud. To add a Function, click on the Functions tab in the menu on the right-hand side of the designer, then choose the function you want to add from the list. 
</p>
<p>Now, you can drag data pieces from another card to empty fields on the Function card. You can also type into any field. Then, drag the result where you want it to go. </p>

5. **Take Action in an App**
<p>You can now take Action in any Channel in response to the starting Event. Create a new record, post to social media, share a file, send a tweet--If your app can do it, Azuqua can do it. 
</p>
<p>To add an Action to your Fl&otilde;, click on the Channel you would like to use in the menu on the right-hand side of the designer. Select the action you would like to use from the list to add the card to your Fl&otilde;.</p>

6. **...And Repeat**
<p>Azuqua lets you connect as many Channels and Functions as you like in one Fl&otilde;. You don't have to settle for one-to-one connections between your apps any more. In theory, you could even connect all the Channels and all the Functions in one Fl&otilde;. We would have tried it by now, but we're a little worried about a Fl&otilde; that powerful becoming self-aware.</p>

7. **Save your Flõ, and sit back.**
<p>When you're done, click the blue "Save Fl&otilde;" button to save your Fl&otilde;. If you're ready for your Fl&otilde; to start running right away, click the orange button that says "Click to Run Fl&otilde;." This Fl&otilde; will now run automatically whenever your starting event occurs. You can also start it later from the "My Fl&otilde;s view.</p>
