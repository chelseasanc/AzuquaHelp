<p>Actions are the automatic steps you can take with an app. Creating or modifying a record, posting to social media, running analytics: if your app can do it, Azuqua can do it. </p>

<ol>
<li>Set up your Fl&otilde. Actions only work after you&#39;ve set up a starting Event, so make sure you&#39;ve done that first. <a href="">Here&#39;s how you can start a Fl&otilde with Pipedrive</a>.</li>
<li>Find Pipedrive in the Channels menu on the right-hand side of the designer and click it to display the list of Actions.</li>
<li>Click on the Action you want to use to add the card to the designer. </li>
<li>Configure the card. You can choose an existing configuration from the drop-down menu or <a href="">create a new configuration</a>. </li>
<li>Now, you can drag or type data into the input fields and drag the results to empty fields on other cards. Read more about how each action works below.</li>
</ol>

        <p><strong>Create a Record</strong></p>

        <p>Use this action to create a new record in Pipedrive. Pipedrive has four basic kinds of records: contacts, activities, organizations, and deals. However, you can also build custom records on Pipedrive. After you&#39;ve configured Pipedrive, Azuqua dynamically generates a list of record types for you to choose from, and creates input fields based on the kind of record type you are trying to create. The input fields for the 4 basic Pipedrive records you can create are below:</p>

        <p><em>Input fields (Activities):</em></p>

        <ul>
        <li><code>subject</code>, the subject of the activity</li>
        <li><code>done</code>, a number representing the status of the activity. 0 = not done, 1 = done. </li>
        <li><code>type</code>, the type of the activity (such as a call, or e-mail conversation).</li>
        <li><code>due_date</code>, the due date of the activity. Format: YYYY-MM-DD</li>
        <li><code>person_id</code>, the ID of the person this activity will be associated with</li>
        <li><code>deal_id</code>, the ID of the deal this activity will be associated with</li>
        <li><code>org_id</code>, the ID of the organization this activity will be associated with</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Output data (Activities):</em>  </p>

        <ul>
        <li><code>id</code>, the unique record ID of the activity in Pipedrive</li>
        </ul>
