1. From the dropdown menu on the Visual Studio card, select “new configuration.”  If you don’t see this menu, click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it over.
2. Enter a name for this Channel configuration (e.g. “Azuqua Visual Studio") and click “Authorize.” Please use letters and numbers only, without punctuation.
3. Enter your account details in the pop-up window and sign in.
4. Click "Accept" to give Azuqua access to your account data. 


Now, you can use this configuration every time you create a Flõ by selecting it from the dropdown menu. You can also create multiple configurations for each channel to link all your accounts to Azuqua. [Read more about managing your configurations from the Settings page.]()
