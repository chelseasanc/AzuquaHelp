<p>Actions are the automatic steps you can take in an app using Azuqua. Creating or modifying a record, posting to social media, running analytics: if your app can do it, Azuqua can do it. </p>

<ol>
<li>Actions only work after you&#39;ve set up a starting Event to trigger your Fl&otilde;, so make sure you&#39;ve done that first. <a href="http://help.azuqua.com/help/article/link/acumatica-events">Here&#39;s how you can start a Fl&otilde; with Acumatica</a>.</li>
<li>Find Acumatica in the Channels menu on the right-hand side of the designer and click it to display the list of Actions.</li>
<li>Click on the Action you want to use to add the card to the designer. </li>
<li>Configure the card. You can choose an existing configuration from the drop-down list or <a href="http://help.azuqua.com/help/article/link/acumatica-config">create a new configuration</a>.</li>
<li>Follow any additional configuration steps specific to this Action (read more below). The card will flip over automatically. </li>
<li>Now, you can drag or type data into the input fields and drag the results to empty fields on other cards.  Read more about how each Action works:</li>

<p>Use the Search action to find a record in Acumatica and return an attribute of that record. In the example on the right, we&#39;re searching for the record ID of a certain Lead. </p>

<ol>
<li>To configure this card, choose the Acumatica Entity you want to search for from the drop-down list. </li>
<li>Choose the Page Group from the drop-down list to narrow down which attributes you would like to return from this record. </li>
<li>Choose the attribute you would like to retrieve from the record from the drop-down list. </li>
<li>The card should flip over automatically. If it doesn&#39;t, click the gear in the corner to flip it over. Azuqua will dynamically generate search fields specific to this record type based on your account data. </li>
<li>Type values into the search fields or drag data from another card and drop it in. <strong>Use specific values, such as a phone number or an email to search for records.</strong> If you are not specific enough and the search values you enter match multiple records, Acumatica will return the attribute associated with the first in that list and your data may not end up in the right place. </li>
<li>Add more cards to your Fl&otilde;: more Actions, other Channels, or Functions.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the bottom of the Search card, then drag the return data to an empty field on another card to use it. </li>
