Events are the triggers that start your Fl&otilde;. Whenever your starting Event happens, the process you've set up will get to work.  

1. Find Acumatica in the Channels menu on the right-hand side of the designer and click it to display the list of Events.
2. Click on the Event you want to use to add the card to the designer. 
3. Configure the card. You can choose an existing configuration from the drop-down list or [create a new configuration](). 
4. Select the Acumatica entities (record types) you want to monitor for updates. Once you've done this, the card will flip over automatically. 
4. Now, add other cards to your Fl&otilde;. Channels, Functions, whatever you want to happen next.
5. Drag data from the Event card to empty fields on other cards and continue building your Fl&otilde;. Read more about each Event:

####Monitor
This Event starts a Fl&otilde; whenever a new record is created in Acumatica, or an existing record is updated. 

The output data from this Event is dynamically generated from your Acumatica entities. The example on the right shows the kind of data that you might see if you decide to monitor for new and updated Contacts.
