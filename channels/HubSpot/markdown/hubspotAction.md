####What kind of Actions can I take in HubSpot?

Actions are the automatic steps you can take with an app. Creating or modifying a record, posting to social media, running analytics: if your app can do it, Azuqua can do it. 

1. Set up your Flõ. Actions only work after you've set up a starting Event, so make sure you've done that first. [Here's how you can start a Flõ with HubSpot]().
2. Find HubSpot in the Channels menu on the right-hand side of the designer and click it to display the list of Actions.
3. Click on the Action you want to use to add the card to the designer. 
4. Configure the card. You can choose an existing configuration from the drop-down menu or [create a new configuration](). Flip the card over by clicking the gear symbol in the top right-hand corner. 
5. Now, you can drag or type data into the input fields and drag the results to empty fields on other cards. Read more about how each action works below.

**Add Contact to List**

**Create a Contact**
<!---Wow that's a lot of fields, are they dynamically generated or can the average user expect to see all these?--->

**Delete a Contact**

**Read Contact by Email**

**Remove Contact from List**
Cofiguring Remove Contact from List takes one extra step. After you've chosen your configuration, choose the list you want to remove the contact from. Then, flip the card over by clicking the gear symbol in the top right-hand corner. 

*Input fields*

* email, the email of the contact you want to remove from the list

**Search Contacts**

**Update a Contact**

**Update a Contact by Email**

<!---Could Search Contacts and Read Contact by Email be combined into one card, with multiple possible search inputs? Same with Update a Contact and Update a Contact by Email? Also, with the Search Actions, if there are multiple results what kind of data will it return?--->
