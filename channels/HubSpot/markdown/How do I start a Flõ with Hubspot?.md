Events are the triggers that start your Fl&otilde;. Whenever your starting Event happens, the process you've set up will get to work.  

1. Find Hubspot in the Channels menu on the right-hand side of the designer and click it to display the list of Events.
2. Click on the Event you want to use to add the card to the designer. 
3. Configure the card. You can choose an existing configuration from the drop-down list or [create a new configuration](). 
4. If possible, choose the list in Hubspot that you want to watch from the drop-down menu. Once this is done the card will flip over automatically. 
4. Now, add other cards to your Fl&otilde;. Actions on other channels, functions, whatever you want to happen next. 
5. Drag data from the Event card to empty fields on other cards and continue building your Fl&otilde;. Read more about each Event:
