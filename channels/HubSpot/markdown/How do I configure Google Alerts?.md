You can use Google Alerts to start a Flõ whenever there's a new result about a keyword you're following on Google. If you don't already have an Alerts account, you can set one up [here](https://www.google.com/alerts).

1. In the menu on the right hand side of the designer, find the Google Alerts Channel, and click it to display a list of Events.
2. Click "Feed" to add the Google Alerts card to the designer.
3. Go to your Google Alerts account and set up an alert if you haven't done so already. 
4. Next to the name of the alert you would like to use to trigger the Flõ, click the pencil icon to edit the alert.
