####How do I configure Marketo?

1. From the dropdown menu on the Marketo card, select “new configuration.”  If you don’t see this menu, click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it over.
2. Enter a name for this Channel configuration (e.g. “Azuqua Marketo")

<!---Ask Lito about the configuration here, what are the pieces needed and where can people get them? What kind of account do they need? --->

Now, you can use this configuration every time you create a Flõ by selecting it from the dropdown menu. You can also create multiple configurations for each channel to link all your accounts to Azuqua. [Read more about managing your configurations from the Settings page.]()
