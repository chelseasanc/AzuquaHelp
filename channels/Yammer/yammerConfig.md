####How do I configure Yammer?

1. From the dropdown menu on the Yammer card, select “new configuration.”  If you don’t see this menu, click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it over.
2. Enter a name for this Channel configuration and click “Authorize.” 
3. Enter your account details in the pop-up window and click “Log In.”

Now, you can use this configuration every time you create a Flõ by selecting it from the dropdown menu. You can also create multiple configurations for each channel to link all your accounts to Azuqua. [Read more about managing your configurations from the Settings page.]()
