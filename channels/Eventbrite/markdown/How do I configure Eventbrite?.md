####How do I configure Eventbrite?

1. From the dropdown menu on the Eventbrite card, select “new configuration.”  If you don’t see this menu, click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it over.
2. Enter a name for this Channel configuration (e.g. “Azuqua Eventbrite”) and click “Authorize.”
3. Enter your account details in the pop-up window and click “Log In.”

4. Enter the ID of the event you want to watch. To find the event ID, log into Eventbrite, click your username in the corner, select the My Events, and then click on the name of your event. Your Event ID will be in the address bar.

Now, you can use this configuration every time you create a Flõ. You can also create multiple configurations for each channel to link all your accounts to Azuqua. [Read more about managing your configurations from the Settings page.]()
