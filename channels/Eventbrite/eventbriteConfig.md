####How do I configure Eventbrite?

1. From the dropdown menu on the Eventbrite card, select “new configuration.”  If you don’t see this menu, click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it over.
2. Enter a name for this Channel configuration (e.g. “Azuqua Eventbrite”) and click “Authorize.”
3. Enter your account details in the pop-up window and click “Sign In.”

Now, you can use this configuration every time you create a Flõ. You can also create multiple configurations for each channel to link all your accounts to Azuqua. [Read more about managing your configurations from the Settings page.]()
