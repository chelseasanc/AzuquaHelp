1. From the dropdown menu on the LinkedIn card, select “new configuration.”  If you don’t see this menu, click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it over.
2. Enter a name for this Channel configuration (e.g. “Azuqua LinkedIn”) and click “Authorize.” If you’re already logged into LinkedIn on this computer, LinkedIn will automatically give us your account information. 
3. Enter your account details in the pop-up window and click “Allow Access.”

Now, you can use this configuration every time you create a Fl&otilde;. You can also create multiple configurations for each channel to link all your accounts to Azuqua. [Read more about managing your configurations from the Settings page.]()<div>
