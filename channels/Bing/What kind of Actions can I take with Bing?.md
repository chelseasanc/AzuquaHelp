Actions are the automatic steps you can take with an app. Creating or modifying a record, posting to social media, running analytics: if your app can do it, Azuqua can do it. 

Actions will only work after you've set up a starting Event for your Flõ. <a href="">Here's how you can start a Flõ with Bing</a>. Once you've done that, find Bing in the Channels menu on the right-hand side of the designer and click on it to display the list of Actions. 

**Search**   
Use the Search Action to search for a term in the middle of a Flõ and send the results to another Channel. 

1. Select Search from the list of Bing Actions to add a card to the designer. 
2. Choose your configuration from the drop-down menu. If you haven't configured  Bing yet, <a href="">here's how</a>.
3. Select the source you would like to search from the dropdown menu. You can search news, images, videos, or the entire web.   
!!Bing Search broken? Nothing shows when I flip over the card.!!
