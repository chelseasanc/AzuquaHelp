Actions are the automatic steps you can take in an app using Azuqua. Creating or modifying a record, posting to social media, running analytics: if your app can do it, Azuqua can do it. 

1. Set up your Fl&otilde. Actions only work after you've set up a starting Event, so make sure you've done that first. [Here's how you can start a Fl&otilde; with Bing]().
2. Find Bing in the Channels menu on the right-hand side of the designer and click it to display the list of Actions.
3. Click on the Action you want to use to add the card to the designer. 
4. Configure the card. You can choose an existing configuration from the drop-down menu or [create a new configuration](). 
5. Now, you can drag or type data into the input fields and drag the results to empty fields on other cards. Read more about how each action works below.

**Search**

Use this action to incorporate a search into your Flo. After setting up your configuration, choose the source you would like to search from the drop-down menu. Then click the gear in the upper right-hand corner of the card to flip it over. 

*Input fields:*

* `query`, the search term you would like to look for

*Output data:*

* `Title`, the title of the result
* `Description`, the description of the result
* `Url`, the URl of the result
* `MediaUrl`, the URl of any media (such as images or video) in the result
