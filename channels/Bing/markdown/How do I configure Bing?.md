####How do I configure the Bing Monitor Event?

1. From the dropdown menu on the Bing card, select “new configuration.”  If you don’t see this menu, click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it over.
2. Enter a name for this Channel configuration (e.g. Azuqua Bing). No apostrophes or quotation marks please!
3. Find your Bing API Key and paste it into the provided field.

4. Click "Save Configuration." 

Now, you can use this configuration every time you create a Flõ by selecting it from the dropdown menu. You can also create multiple configurations for each channel to link all your accounts to Azuqua. To manage your channel configurations, click on your name in the top right-hand corner and select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.
