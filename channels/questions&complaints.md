**General**

* The inconsistencies on card headers is confusing. Every card has "Input" fields and/or "Output" data, and that's how I've been talking about it in the Help Center and IMO it's better information design to have a consistent structure for each card
* Can we find a way to distinguish between optional and mandatory inputs fields?

**Bing**

*Search:*

* Does this only return one result? If not, how does it deal with multiple results?

**Mandrill**

*Send a Templated Message*

* What are the "Merge" fields for?   
* Can we make the "to" input field name more descriptive?  
* When does the user get to decide which template they want to use?


**Marketo**

* No descriptions for add and remove lead actions
* Shouldn't there be a way to choose the list you want to add to for the add/remove lead actions? I don't see one, but I can't configure the channel b/c I don't have the information
* In the Add/Update Lead action, which fields are required/optional?
* With the search lead action, what will you get if there are multiple results? What kind of input values does it take?

**MSDCRM**

* How do I get a burner account to use for screenshots/writing articles?

**Pipedrive**

* Strongly worded suggestion that no card should put out the data it takes in. If they already have it why do they need it? See the Pipedrive Create / Deals card for source of my rage

**Reddit**

*Search Reddit:*

* Is the subreddit a required field, or can they search all of Reddit?
* How will this deal with multiple results?
* what is the "selftext" value? Can't find in Reddit API

*Submit a post*

* What is the format of the input for the subreddit field?
* What is the URl field supposed to take in?

**SendGrid**

*Schedule Marketing Email:*

* There are no input fields to determine which list you should send the email to

**Smartsheet**

*Create contact:*

* What is the `contact` return value supposed to return? The id of the record, the full record?

*New Column:*

* What kind of input does this take? In the Smartsheet docs, it says the input should be all-caps with underscores instead of spaces, should users put anwers in this way?

**Stripe**

*Capture charge:*

* what is the `isCaptured` input field supposed to take? Can't find anything in the Stripe docs
