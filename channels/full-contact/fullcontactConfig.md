####How do I configure FullContact?

FullContact’s business model is based off of selling access to their API. To use the FullContact Channel, first purchase a plan that suits your company’s usage needs.  [You can find information about pricing here.](https://www.fullcontact.com/developer/pricing/) Once you’ve created a FullContact account and purchased a plan, you can get on to using FullContact in Flõs. 

1. From the dropdown menu on the Facebook card, select “new configuration.”  If you don’t see this menu, click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it over.
2. Enter a name for this Channel configuration (e.g. “Azuqua FullContact”).
2. Find your API key. When you sign up for Full Contact, they send you an email containing your API Key. If you no longer have that e-mail, you can [get your API key by signing into the developer portal.](https://portal.fullcontact.com/login)
4. Copy and paste your API Key into the provided field, and click “Save Configuration.”

Now, you can use this configuration every time you create a Flõ. You can also create multiple configurations for each channel to link all your accounts to Azuqua. [Read more about managing your configurations from the Settings page.]()
