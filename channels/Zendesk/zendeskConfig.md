####How do I configure Zendesk?

1. From the dropdown menu on the Zendesk card, select “new configuration.”  If you don’t see this menu, click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it over.
2. Enter a name for this Channel configuration.
3. Enter the name of your Zendesk subdomain (the name of your organization in Zendesk).

Now, you can use this configuration every time you create a Flõ by selecting it from the dropdown menu. You can also create multiple configurations for each channel to link all your accounts to Azuqua. [Read more about managing your configurations from the Settings page.]()
