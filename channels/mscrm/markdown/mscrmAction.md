####What kind of Actions can I take in Microsoft Dynamics CRM?

Actions are the automatic steps you can take with an app. Creating or modifying a record, posting to social media, running analytics: if your app can do it, Azuqua can do it. 

1. Set up your Flõ. Actions only work after you've set up a starting Event, so make sure you've done that first. [Here's how you can start a Flõ with Microsoft Dynamics CRM]().
2. Find Microsoft Dynamics CRM in the Channels menu on the right-hand side of the designer and click it to display the list of Actions.
3. Click on the Action you want to use to add the card to the designer. 
4. Configure the card. You can choose an existing configuration from the drop-down menu or [create a new configuration](). Once this is done the card will flip over automatically. 
5. Now, you can drag or type data into the input fields and drag the results to empty fields on other cards. Read more about how each action works below.
