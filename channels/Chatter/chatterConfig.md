####How do I configure Chatter?


1. From the dropdown menu on the Chatter card, select “new configuration.” If you don’t see this option, click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it over.
2. Enter a name for this Channel configuration (e.g. “Azuqua Chatter”).
3. Select whether this configuration is for a Sandbox or Production account (for more information see the [Salesforce Support article on Sandbox mode](https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=create_test_instance.htm&language=en_US)) and click “authorize.”
4. Enter your account details in the pop-up window and click “Log In.”

Now, you can use this configuration every time you create a Flõ. You can also create multiple configurations for each channel to link all your accounts to Azuqua. [Read more about managing your configurations from the Settings page.](Link to the settings page, whenever that's built)
