3. Select whether this configuration is for a Sandbox or Production account (for more information see the [Salesforce support article on Sandbox mode](https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=create_test_instance.htm&language=en_US)) and click “authorize.”
4. Enter your account details in the pop-up window and click “Log In.”

Now, you can use this configuration every time you create a Fl&otilde;. You can also create multiple configurations for each channel to link all your accounts to Azuqua. [Read more about managing your configurations from the Settings page.]()
