<p>Actions are the automatic steps you can take with an app. Creating or modifying a record, posting to social media, running analytics: if your app can do it, Azuqua can do it. </p>

<ol>
<li>Set up your Fl&otilde;. Actions only work after you&#39;ve set up a starting Event, so make sure you&#39;ve done that first. <a href="">Here&#39;s how you can start a Fl&otilde; with Gmail</a>.</li>
<li>Find Gmail in the Channels menu on the right-hand side of the designer and click it to display the list of Actions.</li>
<li>Click on the Action you want to use to add the card to the designer. </li>
<li>Configure the card. You can choose an existing configuration from the drop-down menu or <a href="">create a new configuration</a>. Flip the card over by pressing the gear symbol in the corner.</li>
<li>Now, you can drag or type data into the input fields and drag the results to empty fields on other cards. Read more about how each action works below.</li>
</ol>
