####How do I configure Mandrill?


1. From the dropdown menu on the XX card, select “new configuration.”  If you don’t see this menu, click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it over.
2. Enter a name for this Channel configuration (e.g. “Azuqua Mandrill").

3. Log into Mandrill and find your API Key.

4. Copy and paste your API key into the available field and click "Authorize."

Now, you can use this configuration every time you create a Flõ by selecting it from the dropdown menu. You can also create multiple configurations for each channel to link all your accounts to Azuqua. [Read more about managing your configurations from the Settings page.]()
