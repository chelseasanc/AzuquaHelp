Actions are the automatic steps you can take with an app. Creating or modifying a record, posting to social media, running analytics: if your app can do it, Azuqua can do it. 

1. Set up your Fl&otilde;. Actions only work after you've set up a starting Event, so make sure you've done that first. [Here's how you can start a Fl&otilde; with Mandrill]().
2. Find Mandrill in the Channels menu on the right-hand side of the designer and click it to display the list of Actions.
3. Click on the Action you want to use to add the card to the designer. 
4. Configure the card. You can choose an existing configuration from the drop-down menu or [create a new configuration](). Once this is done the card will flip over automatically. 
5. Now, you can drag or type data into the input fields and drag the results to empty fields on other cards. Read more about how each action works below.

Use this action to automatically send a pre-built templated message in response to an event on another channel. Combine with Full Contact to reach out to new leads. 

*Input fields:*

* `to`, the email address that you want to send the message to
* `recipient_name`, the full name of the recipient to insert into the template
