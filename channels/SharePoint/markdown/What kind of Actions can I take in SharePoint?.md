2. Find *Channel* in the Channels menu on the right-hand side of the designer and click it to display the list of Actions.
3. Click on the Action you want to use to add the card to the designer. 
4. Configure the card. You can choose an existing configuration from the drop-down menu or [create a new configuration](). Once this is done the card will flip over automatically.
