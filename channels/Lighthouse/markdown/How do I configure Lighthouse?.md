####How do I configure Lighthouse?
To configure Lighthouse, you need to [create an API token](http://help.lighthouseapp.com/kb/api/how-do-i-get-an-api-token) for the project(s) you’re interested in accessing through Azuqua. Once you’ve done that, you’re ready to configure the Channel in the Azuqua designer. 

1. Ftom the dropdown menu on the Dropbox card, select “new configuration.”  If you don’t see this menu, click the gear in the corner of the card to flip it over.
2. Enter a name for this Channel configuration (e.g. “Azuqua Dropbox”)
3. [Sign into Lighthouse.](https://lighthouseapp.com/login)
4. Once you’re logged in, find the API Token and your Lighthouse domain name, and paste them into the available fields.
